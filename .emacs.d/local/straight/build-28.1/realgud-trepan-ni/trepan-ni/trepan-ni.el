  "Invoke the trepan-ni shell debugger and start the Emacs user interface.

String OPT-CMD-LINE specifies how to run trepan-ni.

OPT-CMD-LINE is treated like a shell string; arguments are
tokenized by `split-string-and-unquote'.  The tokenized string is
parsed by `trepan-ni-parse-cmd-args' and path elements found by that
are expanded using `realgud:expand-file-name-if-exists'.

Normally, command buffers are reused when the same debugger is
reinvoked inside a command buffer with a similar command.  If we
discover that the buffer has prior command-buffer information and
NO-RESET is nil, then that information which may point into other
buffers and source buffers which may contain marks and fringe or
marginal icons is reset.  See `loc-changes-clear-buffer' to clear
fringe and marginal icons."
